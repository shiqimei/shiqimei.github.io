# Search Console

## Overview

Verify site ownership and submit sitemaps to Google Search Console for SEO indexing.

## When to Use This Skill

- "Submit sitemap to Google"
- "Add site to Search Console"
- "Verify site ownership"
- "Index my site on Google"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Site Ownership (HTML File Method)

1. Open Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click property selector > "Add property"
3. Select "URL prefix" and enter site URL (e.g., `https://shiqimei.github.io/`)
4. Download the verification HTML file (e.g., `googlea41df2ceb95244f2.html`)
5. Add file to repo root and push:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/google*.html /path/to/repo/
git add -A && git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification file" && git push
```

6. Wait for deployment, verify file is accessible:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://yoursite.com/googleXXXXXXXX.html
# Should return 200
```

7. Click "Verify" in Search Console

### Step 2: Submit Sitemap

1. In Search Console, go to Indexing > Sitemaps
2. Enter sitemap path (e.g., `sitemap.xml`)
3. Click Submit

Initial status will show "Couldn't fetch" - this is normal. Google processes new sitemaps within hours to a day.

## Notes

- Keep verification file permanently - removing it will lose verification
- GitHub Pages sites use URL prefix method (can't modify DNS for github.io)
- Sitemap should be auto-generated by build system and include all URLs
