<p>Some thoughts on where we&#39;re heading. The relationship between humans and AI agents in production is undergoing a fundamental shift. Here&#39;s my forecast.</p>
<h2>The Paradigm Shift: Human-Centric to Agent-Centric</h2>
<p>For decades, all production tools have been designed around humans. We build UIs, optimize UX, create intuitive interfaces. The underlying assumption: humans are the primary consumers of these tools.</p>
<p>This is changing.</p>
<p>The next wave of tools will be built for agents. Not &quot;agent-friendly&quot; in the sense of having good APIs - that&#39;s table stakes. I mean tools designed from the ground up with AI agents as the primary user. No GUI needed. Pure programmatic interfaces. The &quot;death of the GUI&quot; for production systems.</p>
<p>When your primary user doesn&#39;t need visual feedback, doesn&#39;t get confused by complex interfaces, and can process thousands of parameters simultaneously - the design calculus changes completely.</p>
<h2>The Job Progression</h2>
<p>AI will consume jobs progressively. The pattern:</p>
<img src="../images/job-progression.svg" alt="Job Progression Stages" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;margin:1.5rem 0;">

<p>The key insight: autonomy increases where error tolerance is high and reversibility is easy. Coding came early because <code>git revert</code> exists. Surgery comes late because you can&#39;t undo a cut.</p>
<p>As AI consumes more job categories, society&#39;s overall autonomy rate rises:</p>
<img src="../images/autonomy-chart.svg" alt="Autonomy vs Jobs Automated Chart" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;margin:1.5rem 0;">

<p>In the near future, 90% or even 95% of work won&#39;t require human involvement. People won&#39;t need to engage in low-level tasks.</p>
<h2>The Acceleration Loop</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s where it gets exponential.</p>
<p>AI systems can bootstrap themselves. Mining resources, collecting energy, manufacturing, deploying more AI. The term is &quot;self-replicating systems&quot; - what Elon Musk calls the &quot;seed factory&quot; concept.</p>
<p>Once this loop closes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computation breeds computation</li>
<li>Energy collection scales automatically</li>
<li>Physical production becomes software-like (deploy, scale, iterate)</li>
</ul>
<p>The implication: we could see 10x or 100x productivity gains in a compressed timeframe. Not decades. Years. Maybe less.</p>
<p>Caveat: Physical world constraints slow things down. Atoms move slower than bits. But the direction is clear.</p>
<h2>The Social Impact</h2>
<h3>Most Jobs Disappear</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s be direct: most current jobs will be replaced. Not &quot;transformed&quot; - replaced.</p>
<p>A small group will remain essential: those who compose, orchestrate, and direct AI systems. They&#39;ll push civilization forward. Everyone else becomes economically redundant in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t pessimism. It&#39;s physics. If a machine does the work better, faster, and cheaper, the economic logic is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Human Society Continues</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s the counterintuitive part: society doesn&#39;t collapse. It continues.</p>
<p>Why? Human desires don&#39;t change with abundance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Status games persist (positional goods become more important)</li>
<li>Meaning-seeking intensifies</li>
<li>Novel experiences become the ultimate currency</li>
<li>Legacy and impact drive behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Poor people will want more. Rich people will protect what they have. The flow continues. Different inputs, same dynamics.</p>
<h3>The Safety Net</h3>
<p>Basic compensation becomes necessary. Not charity - dividend from collective AI productivity.</p>
<p>Most people won&#39;t need to work. If they accept baseline quality of life, they&#39;re covered. If they want more, they learn to collaborate with AI systems, organize agents, pursue interesting problems.</p>
<p>The divide isn&#39;t capital vs. labor anymore. It&#39;s AI-fluent vs. AI-illiterate.</p>
<h2>The Transition Problem</h2>
<p>The dangerous window: AI can do most jobs, but post-scarcity hasn&#39;t arrived. Unemployment spikes while abundance is still building. This gap is where political and social instability lives.</p>
<p>We need to navigate this carefully. The destination might be fine. The journey is treacherous.</p>
<h2>The Control Question</h2>
<p>Who directs the agent swarms?</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate entities? (concentration of power)</li>
<li>Governments? (bureaucratic inefficiency)</li>
<li>Decentralized systems? (coordination problems)</li>
</ul>
<p>This question shapes everything. The technical capability is one thing. The governance is another entirely.</p>
<h2>The Creativity Question</h2>
<p>If AI can create, what&#39;s left for humans?</p>
<p>My take: &quot;human-made&quot; becomes a luxury brand. Authenticity replaces skill as the valued trait. We want things made by humans not because they&#39;re better, but because they&#39;re human.</p>
<p>Art, craft, performance - these become statements of identity rather than demonstrations of capability.</p>
<h2>The Speed Differential</h2>
<p>AI systems will eventually operate on timescales incomprehensible to us. A year of AI progress might equal centuries of human-paced development.</p>
<p>How do humans stay relevant in decision-making when the advisors think a million times faster?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have an answer. But it&#39;s the right question.</p>
<hr>
<p>The production relationship between humans and AI is inverting. <strong>We built tools for ourselves. Now we&#39;re building tools for the tools. And soon, the tools will build tools for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>The question isn&#39;t whether this happens. It&#39;s how we navigate the transition.</p>
