        <p>After using a Windows PE tool to create a bootable USB drive, I found that the Deepin Boot Maker could no longer detect my USB drive. Formatting the drive, restarting the computer - nothing worked. Here&#39;s what was happening and how to fix it.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>When you create a PE bootable drive with certain tools, Windows may start recognizing your USB drive as a &quot;Local Disk&quot; instead of a &quot;Removable Disk&quot;. The Deepin Boot Maker (and many other Linux boot disk creators) intentionally ignore local disks to prevent accidentally overwriting your system drive.</p>
<p>You can verify this in Windows Disk Management (Win+X → Disk Management). If your USB drive shows as &quot;Basic&quot; disk instead of &quot;Removable&quot;, that&#39;s the issue.</p>
<h2>Why This Happens</h2>
<p>USB drives can operate in two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removable Media Mode</strong>: Normal USB drive behavior, recognized as removable storage</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Disk Mode</strong>: Drive behaves like an internal hard disk</li>
</ul>
<p>Some PE creation tools modify the USB drive&#39;s mode to Fixed Disk to support features like multiple partitions. Once in this mode, Windows treats it as a local disk.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>The workaround is to run Deepin Boot Maker from within a PE environment, where the disk filtering behavior is different:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Deepin Boot Maker for PE environments</li>
<li>Create a bootable PE drive using your preferred PE tool (the same one that caused the issue works fine)</li>
<li>Boot into the PE environment</li>
<li>Run <code>deepin-boot-maker.exe</code> from within PE</li>
<li>The USB drive should now be visible and selectable</li>
</ol>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This solution only applies when the USB was previously converted to Fixed Disk mode by PE creation tools</li>
<li>Some USB drives (notably certain SanDisk models) ship in Fixed Disk mode by default - these may not work with Deepin Boot Maker at all</li>
<li>If your USB drive isn&#39;t recognized even in PE, the drive may be defective or permanently configured as a fixed disk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternative: Reset USB to Removable Mode</h2>
<p>On some USB drives, you can reset to removable mode using the <code>diskpart</code> command, though this doesn&#39;t work on all drives:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Run as Administrator
diskpart
list disk
select disk X    # Replace X with your USB disk number
clean
create partition primary
format fs=fat32 quick
exit</code></pre><p>If the drive still shows as &quot;Basic&quot; instead of &quot;Removable&quot; after this, the PE environment workaround is your best option.</p>
